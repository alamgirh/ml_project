Human Head Orientation Estimation using Hopenet

The goal of this project is to build a neural network model to estimate human head orientation from videos or images using a provided dataset. This dataset contains video recording of moving people and their groundtruth head orientation recorded by Vicon motion tracking system. Interested students can either use current state-of-the-art methods or develop their own neural network models to detect human head orientation using this provided dataset.
